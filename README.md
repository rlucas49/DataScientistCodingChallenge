# Data Scientist Coding Challenge
This page contains a coding challenge for Data Scientist roles at Circle K.

# Purpose
The goals of this test are threefold:
- evaluate your coding abilities
- judge your technical experience
- understand how you design a solution

# How you will be judged
You will be scored on:
1. coding standards, comments, and readability of your code
2. how you approached the problems
3. overall solution design (i.e. if the problem is solved)
4. appropriate use of source control

# Instructions
- You are writing code that only other data scientists will see. No UI is required, but all your work and results must be viewable.
- You may use any Open Source solution for storing work and results, but a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab are particularly suited for these tasks. Jupyter Notebook comes with the Anaconda installation of Python. There are also other online versions where you can work (see: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jupyter/jupyterlab_installation_and_getting_started.htm#:~:text=Visit%20https%3A%2F%2Fjupyter.org,and%20tabs%20and%20settings%20view.) Pick one.
- Once the test is completed, please email the .ipynb file to Rich Lucas (rich.lucas@circlek.com) so he can review your work


# Challenge #1 â€“ User Accounts and Viewing History

Table 1: table_video_viewing

Table 2: table_account_info


### Create solutions using SQL, Python, or R that answer the following:
- Q1a: Write a query that will return the first title watched for each user.
- Q1b: Write a query that will give me total viewing time in minutes of each title in September 2021.
- Q1c: Write a query that will give me the share of minutes (as a percentage) Ruthless was viewed in September 2021.
- Q1d: Write a query that will give me the share of minutes viewed (as a percentage) with a premium account.


# Challenge #2 - Manipulating Strings with Python

### Create solutions using Python that answer the following:
- Q2a: Given the input s1 = "bbabcabcbb", find the length of the longest repeating substring. ('abc' and 'bb' are the two substrings.)
- Q2b: Write a function that will find the length of the longest repeating substring for:
    i. s1 = "bbabcabcbb" 
    ii. s2 = "bbbbb"
    iii. s3 = "pwwkew"


# Challenge #3 - 



# Bonus point
- Candidate should put their final Jupyter Notebook in a code repository hosted on Github (it can be public or private).
- Please include details on how to access the repo so we can see your work.
